[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/niclabs/tcpaillier?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/niclabs/tcpaillier)

This code is based on the implementation of Threshold Paillier Encryption Scheme from 
[UTDallas](http://cs.utdallas.edu/dspl/cgi-bin/pailliertoolbox/index.php). That implementation is based on the
paper from Ivan Damgard [A Generalization of Paillier's Public Key System with Applications to Electronic Voting](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/voting/papers/DamgardJurikNielsen-AGeneralizationOfPailliersPublicKeySystemWithApplicationsToElectronicVoting.pdf)
